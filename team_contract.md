# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 
Our team will meet once a week, with the meeting time varying based on our schedules. Each meeting should last an hour or more, depending on what we need to complete for the week. We will host these meetings in person. There is no need to assign someone as the dedicated note taker, but we will write down important ideas as needed.

2. **Assistance** 
When in need of assistance or feedback on a task, teammates should use Discord as the main communication channel. Teammates should be expected to respond within the day, and hopefully within a few hours.

3. **Respect** 
We will ensure the open expression of ideas by systematically allowing each group member to explain their stance on each issue. The environment will be respectful and open to all ideas without negative, unnecessary criticism.

## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
The workload for this project will be split up relatively evenly among all group members. This is because we all have relatively similar strengths and desires regarding the project. We will give ample time before deadlines in order to prevent failure to complete work in the event of unforeseen circumstances.

5. **Time Commitment** 
~2 hours per week of work is expected from each group member. There are no prior time commitments to be accounted for. When new conflicts or commitments inevitably occur, we will adjust deadlines and work alottment accordingly.

6. **Conflict Resolution** 
When there are disagreements between group members, we will cast votes in order to collectively come to an agreement. When group members have not accomplished their tasks, we will ask them why they have not done their tasks and see if further instruction needs to be provided to help them get started. Habitually late members will again be asked about their attendance and meeting times may possibly be adjusted in order to fit everyone's schedules. If issues can't be resolved as a group, we will inform course staff.
